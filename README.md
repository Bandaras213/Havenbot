# Haven Bot by xTobiShotz
**Firstly I would like to mention that this my first programming project!**
**Lots of things are hard coded, some of the code is messy but I'm sure that as I learn these things all of it will improve!**

## Config.json file
| Setting | Default | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| token | "DISCORD_TOKEN | Discord Bot Token. |
| ownerID | "OWNER_ID" | Discord ID of the owner. |
| prefix | "." | Prefix used for commands. |
| ffxivapikey | "API_KEY" | xivapi.com API Key. |

## Index.js
**This is the file where everything gets called etc.**

## Functions, Events and Commands

* ## Functions
  - **Log**
	+ Formats messages for console logging. Errors still look a bit wonky but it works.

- ## Events
	+ **Ready**
	  * Logs when the bot is ready and sets a random Gold Saucer game as playing activity every 5 minutes.
	+ **Message**
		* Picks up messages to filter out the prefix and commands to execute and execute them.
	+ **GuildmemberAdd**
		* Welcomes the user that joined in the #main channel, assigns the "Visitor" role and sends an embed with some of their Discord information to #memberlog.
	+ **GuildmemberRemove**
		* Sends an embed with some Discord information of the user that left to #memberlog.
	+ **Error**
		* This logs erros such as disconnects and lets it auto reconnect.
 + ## Commands 
 
 	* ### Admin Roles Only
		- **say**
			+ Lets the bot say anything and deletes the original message.

	* ### Verification
		- **iam**
			+ Fetches XIVAPI data of a given Charactername to see if it exits and what Rank they are inside the Free Company. Changes their Nickname and assigns them their Rank Role, then sends an embed with their Lodestone information and Discord tag. (Server is always Ragnarok)

			+ Dice rolling with 6 and 20 sided dice.
